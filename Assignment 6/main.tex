\section{Part A: Getting data from Social web media}

\subsection{Activity 1}

In the file \emph{home_timeline.jsonl} there is my personal timeline (i.e. tweets about people that I am following) from Twitter and all the informations related to these profiles. I can retrieve my own tweets looking at the attribute \emph{screen_name}. The code is parsing my timeline, obtaining informations and meta-data about the tweets contained in it and the related profiles.

Looking at the hashtags I can have an insight to events and locations related to the analyzed profile.

\subsection{Activity 2}
